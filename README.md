## Contributor warning

The `npm-shrinkwrap.json` generated by `make` is for publishing only; don’t run any npm commands that read or affect `node_modules` while it exists. In particular, if `npm-shrinkwrap.json` exists and `npm install` is run, `package-lock.json` will offer no protection and npm will silently install the entire current tap dependency tree missing from `npm-shrinkwrap.json`.

If `npm-shrinkwrap.json` doesn’t exist when publishing, `npm publish` and `npm pack` will silently skip it, though it’s listed in `package.json`’s `files`. Please ensure it exists.
